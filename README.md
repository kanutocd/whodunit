# Whodunit

Lightweight creator/updater/deleter tracking for Rails ActiveRecord models.

> **Fun Fact**: The term "whodunit" was coined by literary critic Donald Gordon in 1930 when reviewing a murder mystery novel for _American News of Books_. He described Milward Kennedy's _Half Mast Murder_ as "a satisfactory whodunit" - the first recorded use of this now-famous term for mystery stories!

## Overview

Whodunit provides simple auditing for Rails applications by tracking who created, updated, and deleted records. Unlike heavyweight solutions like PaperTrail or Audited, Whodunit focuses solely on user tracking with zero performance overhead.
